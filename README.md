# jetson-object-detection

Following the success of my other project, [rpi-object-detection](https://github.com/automaticdai/rpi-object-detection), I am making this new project focusing on Jetson. As many configurations are different on Jetson, I think this is a better way to have a new repo, rather than a hybrid integration to support multiple platforms.

This repo should support:

- Jetson Nano 2GB / 4GB
- Jetson Orin
- Jetson Orin Super
- Jetson AGX Orin
- Jetson AGX and AGX Xaiver

## Requirements
- Jetpack
- opencv2
- pytorch

## License
