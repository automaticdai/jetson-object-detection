# jetson-object-detection

Following the success of my other project, [rpi-object-detection](https://github.com/automaticdai/rpi-object-detection), I am making this new project focusing on Jetson. As many configurations are different on Jetson, I think this is a better way to have a new repo, rather than a hybrid integration to support multiple platforms.

This repo is developed with Jetson Nano and Jetson Orin NX, and it should support:

- Jetson Nano (2019)
- Jetson Xavier NX (2020)
- Jetson Orin Nano (2023)
- Jeston Orin NX (2023)
- Jetson AGX Orin (2023)
- Jetson Orin Nano Super (2024)
- Jetson AGX Thor (2025)

However, there is no support for older boards including:
- Jetson TK1 (2014)
- Jetson TX1 (2015)
- Jetson TX2 (2017)
- Jetson AGX Xavier (2018)
